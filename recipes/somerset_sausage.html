    <h1>Somerset Sausage</h1>
    <img src="../images/sausage.jpg">
    <h4>The Ideal Comfort Food For a Cold Winters Day</h4>
    <p>Somerset Sausage is a <em>west country twist</em> on the classic sausage casserole. A dish which is light on calories while
    remaining <strong>hearty</strong> and wholesome, whilst having very little to demand in the washing up department! The cider
    combines well with the butter beans to give you <em>a hint of sweetness</em> in the gravy.
